title: Building a homescreen for my kitchen

A practice that I've found exceptionally productive in many aspects of my life is _journalling._
It's been so productive because I have this funny combination of traits: I'm very forgetful and I
hate making mistakes. I _will_ make the same mistake twice, unless I write down how things went
down last time, so I can readjust next time.

As a practice, journalling led to a few outstanding results for me.
- In an internship I did in 2017, I meticulously journalled during my work. Back then I was into
  pen and paper, and over the course of those 10 weeks I spent as an intern, I filled two
  notebooks. I'd often write down ideas for how to make progress my project, write down how I'd
  test those ideas, and write down how the experiment went.
- During my graduate studies, I spent a lot of time developing an interactive extension to
  [Beluga](https://github.com/Beluga-lang/Beluga). By the time I got to it, Beluga had already been
  developed very organically by a revolving door of grad students over the preceding ten years or
  so. Let's just say that the code was hard to navigate.
