title: 'Implementing dependent types: how hard could it be? (Part 3)'
---

Short answer: hard, but not as hard as I thought.

* [Part 1](/posts/2025-05-23-depty-impl.html): Normalization by Evaluation, an extensible approach
part 2 covered bidirectional typechecking
* [Part 2](/posts/2025-06-31-depty-impl-part-2.html): bidirectional typechecking, substitutions

This is the final part of a series of posts on the implementation of a dependently-typed
lambda-calculus.
