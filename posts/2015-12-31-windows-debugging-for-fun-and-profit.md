title: Windows debugging for fun and profit
---

I had an old friend visiting over the holidays. When he asked me for some help
regarding assembly, I knew I'd be in for some fun.

He likes to play Japanese visual novels and other games as a way to learn
Japanese. However, typing kana can be difficult, since that requires knowing
how to read the kana. For the hiragana and katakana syllabaries, it's not so
bad since they're only about 40 characters a piece. For kanji on the other
hand, knowing the correct readings can take a lot of study time.

Since these are games, you can't just copy and paste the text into a
dictionary; the text is *drawn* on the window. However, at some point, before
being rendered, the text does exist as *text* in the program memory. Inserting
a hook into the drawing routine for text would be enough to extract those
characters and display them in another window, or write them to the clipboard.

There are already some general-purpose tools to do this, such as Anime Games
Text Hooker (AGTH), which can be used to hook the text of many games using
so-called H-codes. An H-code specifies a hook location and some rudimentary
code for how to interpret the processor state at the hook location in order to
extract the character. For example, an H-code could specify that the breakpoint
is at address `0x008A0275` and that the character is in register `eax`.

If only it were that simple. In lots of Japanese software, especially games,
text is encoded not in ASCII, nor in Unicode, but in Shift-JIS (SJIS). Some
SJIS characters are coded on one byte, and some are coded on two bytes, with
the distinguishing characteristic between the two being the value of the first
byte: if the first byte is less that `0x80`, then the character is coded on one
byte; else, the character is coded on two bytes.

Accordingly, H-codes are somewhat more complicated, as the breakpoint given in
an H-code might only have one half of a character.

All that to say that I couldn't manage to write an H-code for this game that my
friend was interested in.

But instead of giving up, I decided instead that I could just write a little
debugger of my own, that would insert a breakpoint at the right place in the
game's code, inspect the processor state to find the text address, and read the
game's memory to extract the text.

It can't be that hard can it ?

Exploring the game's code
-------------------------

First we need to find out where the game's code reads the text, so that we can
insert our hook there.

Let's fire up the game and hook it with Cheat Engine. The only hint I have to
go on from my friend is the first string that a character says in game.

> どうだ……ティオ？

Let's search for the string shortly before it gets displayed. The rationale for
doing this is that we'll find an address pointing to some kind of text or event
script database rather than some kind of transient memory.
Since we want to find the code that reads from this address, let's put a read
watchpoint on the address, and then wait for the text to get displayed. Here's
what that all looks like on screen after the watchpoint gets hit.

<img class='figure figure-natural' alt="Yes, this is running in Windows XP." src="/img/cheat-engine-debugging.png"/>

Note that the string that we searched for is highlighted in the memory view
window since we have watchpoints on those addresses.

It looks like the address gets read several times in fact! Since all these
instructions run about the same number of times, I suppose it doesn't really
matter which one we pick to use for our hook, so let's just arbitrarily pick
the first one.

In the extra info window, we can see that the address of the string that we
found is held in the `eax` register. This *looks* like it's where we would want
to put our hook, but frankly, I'm not convinced yet.

To start with a clean slate, let's restart the game. Then let's put a
breakpoint on the instruction to see what triggers it and to inspect the
processor state when the instruction executes.

Each time the instruction executes, the value of `eax` seems to be increasing.
To me, this suggests that it's reading the text character by character. That
also explains why our watchpoint was triggered several times: our watchpoint
was spread out over the string we searched for and characters are being read
one by one. Let's follow `eax` and see how the text is being
read.

```
23 30 30 30 31 46 23 31 31 50 82 C7 82 A4 82 BE 81 63 81 63 83 65 83 42 83 49 81 48 02 00
^^                ^^          ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^    ^^ ^^
```

The top row shows successive bytes of memory of memory starting at the address
pointed to by `eax` the first time the breakpoint hit up to the address pointed
to by `eax` after which continuing the execution of the program returned
execution completely to the game, breaking execution out of the loop it seemed
to be in.

The bottom row shows precisely which byte `eax` was pointing at when the
breakpoint hit. The breaks all occurred from left to right.

Now, `82 C7 82 A4 82 BE 81 63 81 63 83 65 83 42 83 49 81 48` is simply the
Shift-JIS encoding of `どうだ……ティオ？`. But what's the rest? The `00` at the
end is surely just a null terminator. The `02` is probably also some kind of
end-of-message signal.

What about the beginning though?
Let's look at it in ASCII.

```
23 30 30 30 31 46 23 31 31 50
#  0  0  0  1  F  #  1  1  P
```

No idea what that means, but it's probably some kind of metadata since it
doesn't appear explicitly in the displayed text.

Let's look at the text-script for the next message, which is longer and more
complicated.

```
23 36 50 23 30 32 30 36 46
#  6  P  #  0  2  0  6  F

81 63 81 63 88 AB 82 A2 97 5C 8A B4 82 AA 93 49 92 86 82 C5 82 B7 81 42
…     …     悪    い    予    感    が    的    中    で    す    。

02 03
?? ??

23 30 32 30 38 46
#  0  2  0  8  F

8E 9E 81 45 8B F3 81 45 8C B6 81 63 81 63

上    位    三    属    性    が    働    い    て    い    ま    す    。

02 03

23 30 32 30 31 46
#  0  2  0  1  F

81 73 93 83 81 74 82 E2 81 73 91 6D 89 40 81 74 82 C6 93 AF 82 B6 82 C5 82 B7 82 CB 81 42
《    塔    》    や    《    僧    院    》    と    同    じ    で    す    ね    。

02 00
?? end
```

And this is the result of this text-script in-game.

<img class='figure figure-natural' alt="A single line of text with eyes closed." src='/img/text-script-result-1.png'/>

<img class='figure figure-natural' alt="Two lines of text with eyes to the right." src='/img/text-script-result-2.png'/>

<img class='figure figure-natural' alt="A single line of text with eyes to the left." src='/img/text-script-result-3.png'/>

Comparing the result with the script, it looks like `#XXXXF` identifies the
speaker's face, the `02` marker acts as `end-of-panel`, `01` acts as a line
break, and `03` acts as `next-panel`.

Comparing for a few more messages like this suggests that `#XXP` identifies
which character is speaking.

So this instruction `movzx ecx, byte ptr [eax]` at address `0x008A0275` is
precisely where we want to put our hook. Each time the breakpoint hits, we have
a sort of cursor in memory given by `eax`, and depending on the value under the
cursor, we can figure out when panels break, when lines end, who's speaking,
etc.

It's everything we could ever want in a text hook and more !

Building the debugger
---------------------

### Setting the breakpoint

Debugging a program is a very event-driven process. The debugger responds to
different events that occur in the program such as the program starting and
ending, loading and releasing DLLs, creating and destroying threads, and
throwing exceptions. The latter kind of event is the one that interests us the
most because breakpoints are implemented as exceptions. In fact, a breakpoint
is nothing more than a special kind of instruction, `int 3`, affectionately
called "trap to debugger", that when handled by Windows will cause the running
program to throw a special kind of debug exception which can then be handled by
a debugger.

The interrupt instruction is coded on two bytes, with the first distinguishing
it from other types of two-byte opcodes and the second being an arbitrary
one-byte value to use as the interrupt number. However, the trap to debugger
interrupt is so useful that it has its own dedicated one-byte opcode `0xCC`.

All that's great, but it means that the `int 3` instruction needs to be in the
program code to begin with so that we can debug it. That's a
specifically *opt-in* debugging strategy. In order to insert a breakpoint into
a program without it necessarily asking for it, we need to overwrite (part of)
the instruction we want to break on with `0xCC`. That destroys the original
instruction though, so we have to find some way to nonetheless execute the
original instruction. We'll get to that later though.

In Windows, we can change the memory of a running process with the
`WriteProcessMemory` function. However, we don't want to change *regular* data.
We want to change the program code, which is in the `.text` segment of the
process memory, and the `.text` segment is *read-only*. Well, "read-only" is
really just a nebulous sort of hocus pocus concept anyway. To change the
protection of memory regions in another process, it suffices to use the
`VirtualProtectEx` function, which according to the documentation "changes the
protection on a region of committed pages in the virtual address space of a
specified process." That's just fancy OS jargon for "make read only memory
writable" or "make data memory executable" in another process.

However, it would be pretty ridiculous if any old process could just write to
the memory of another process or its memory protection. `WriteProcessMemory`
requires the `PROCESS_VM_WRITE` and `PROCESS_VM_OPERATION` permissions and
`VirtualProtectEx` requires just the `PROCESS_VM_OPERATION` permission. Also,
these two functions require a `HANDLE` on the target process.

There are two strategies for acquiring a handle on a process and getting the
necessary privileges.

1. Using the `CreateProcess` function and passing the `DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS`
   flag. This confers all privileges on the child process to the parent
   process, and `CreateProcess` conveniently returns a handle to the child.
2. Using the `OpenProcess` function passing in the process ID and the bitwise
   OR of the desired privileges. This can only be done if the process wanting
   to acquire the handle has the `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege in its *access
   token*.

In the former case, our text hooking program would be taking care of spawing
the game. In the latter case, our software would be hooking into the game after
the game has started.

The first option sounds simpler than the second option, but when I tried it,
`CreateProcess` would always fail with rather obscure error codes. On the other
hand, I've successfully managed to use the second strategy in the past, so I
figured I might as well give it a go again. Also, I personally find the second
strategy more elegant in the sense that the concerns of the software are better
separated.

Processes sadly don't just start with the `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege in their
access token, so we need to modify our program's access token using the
`AdjustTokenPrivileges` function after getting a handle on our access token
using the `OpenProcessToken` function passing in the `TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES`
and `TOKEN_QUERY` flags.

After acquiring the `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege, we need to get the process ID
of the game so that we can use `OpenProcess` and finally call
`VirtualProtectEx` and `WriteProcessMemory`. We can list all running processes
and compare their executable's name with the name of the game's executable
(which is rather distinctive, so it's unlikely that we'll accidentally get
something else) using the functions `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`,
`Process32First` and `Process32Next`.

The first of those three creates a snapshot of the running processes. The
`Process32First` and `Process32Next` functions allow us to walk over the
snapshot, getting a `PROCESSENTRY32` struct for each of them. This struct has
two important fields.

* `szExeFile` holds the name of the executable that spawned the process.
* `th32ProcessID` holds the process ID that we can use with `OpenProcess`.

All that being said, here's the code for setting the breakpoint.

First, we have to escalate the privileges of our process so that it can call
`OpenProcess`.

```c++
HANDLE token;
// ^ our process's access token
LUID debug_luid;
// ^ the locally-unique identifier for the SeDebugPrivilege privilege

// Look up the SeDebugPrivilege privilege's LUID.
if(!LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, SE_DEBUG_NAME, &debug_luid))
{
    printf("Failed to look up debug privilege name. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// Open our process's access token with the necessary privileges to modify it.
if(!OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES | TOKEN_QUERY, &token))
{
    printf("Failed to open process access token. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// The TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure expected by AdjustTokenPrivileges uses the
// so-called 'struct hack' to have dynamic size, so we have to allocate enough
// memory for the structure itself plus one item for the contents of the
// dynamic array at the end.
PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES tp
    = (PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES)malloc(sizeof(*tp) + sizeof(LUID_AND_ATTRIBUTES));

tp->PrivilegeCount = 1;
tp->Privileges[0].Luid = debug_luid;
tp->Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;

// Adjust the privileges in our token.
if(!AdjustTokenPrivileges(token, FALSE, tp, sizeof(*tp), NULL, NULL))
{
    printf("Failed to adjust token privileges. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// Clean up
CloseHandle(token);
free(tp);
```

Next, we have to enumerate the running processes to find the process ID of the
game.

```c++
HANDLE process_snapshot;
// ^ A handle to the snapshot of the currently running processes
PROCESSENTRY32 pe;
// ^ A single process entry, used as the traverse the snapshot.
char found;
// ^ A boolean for whether we found the game or not.

// Create the snapshot of the currently running processes.
if(INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE ==
    (process_snapshot = CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0)))
{
    printf("Failed to get process list. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// Before using Process32First, we need to initialize the size of the
// destination structure, for some reason.
pe.dwSize = sizeof(pe);

// Get the first process entry.
if(!Process32First(process_snapshot, &pe))
{
    printf("Failed to get process from list. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// And start the loop to traverse the snapshot.
found = 0;
do
{
    // Compare the name of the process's executable with the expected name of
    // the game's executable.
    if(wcscmp(pe.szExeFile, GAME_PATH) == 0)
    {
        found = 1;
        break;
    }
}
while(Process32Next(process_snapshot, &pe));

if(!found)
{
    printf("Failed to find ED_ZERO.exe; is the game running?\n");
    exit(1);
}

// Get the handle on the game's process with all privileges.
// This includes the necessary PROCESS_VM_WRITE and PROCESS_VM_OPERATION
// privileges.
if(NULL ==
    (game_process = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, pe.th32ProcessID)))
{
    printf("Failed to open ED_ZERO.exe process. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// Attach ourselves as a debugger to the process.
if(!DebugActiveProcess(pe.th32ProcessID))
{
    printf("Failed to debug ED_ZERO.exe process.\n");
}
```

Finally, we can set the breakpoint in the process memory.

```c++
SIZE_T b;
// ^ Used as an out parameter for the number of bytes written to the process
// memory.

DWORD newprot = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE;
// ^ The protection that we want to set on the code so that we can write to it.

DWORD oldprot;
// ^ Used as an out parameter for the old memory protection value.

const unsigned char int3 = 0xCC;
// ^ The `int 3` instruction opcode.

// Set the memory protection to our new value.
// `instruction_address` is the address of the instruction that we want to
// modify. We only want to change one byte, so we set the length of memory to
// change to `1`.
if(!VirtualProtectEx(game_process, instruction_address, 1, newprot, &oldprot))
{
    printf("Failed to weaken memory protection. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}

// Write the opcode to the instruction we want to break on.
if(!WriteProcessMemory(game_process, instruction_address, &int3, 1, &b))
{
    printf("Failed to set breakpoint.\n");
    exit(1);
}

// Restore the old memory protection to avoid possibly upsetting the game.
if(!VirtualProtectEx(game_process, instruction_address, 1, oldprot, &newprot))
{
    printf("Failed to reset memory protection. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
    exit(1);
}
```

And now the breakpoint is set!

### Writing the debugger loop

Like I said earlier, debugging is an event-driven process. Now we need to write
the event loop that will handle debugging events, in particular exceptions, so
that we can actually do the text extraction.

The key function is `WaitForDebugEvent`. This function will block execution of
the debugger until a debug event is received, and write it to an out parameter.
We can then dispatch to a specialized event handler according to the type of
event. In our case, we dispatch to a handler for debug exceptions (created by
the `int 3` instruction we wrote into the code) and ignore all other events.
When we're done processing the event, we call `ContinueDebugEvent`. Until we
call `ContinueDebugEvent`, the thread that triggered the event will be
suspended.

```c++
void debug_loop()
{
    DEBUG_EVENT event;
    ZeroMemory(&event, sizeof(event));

    for(;;)
    {
        // Block until we receive a debug event.
        if(!WaitForDebugEvent(&event, INFINITE))
        {
            printf("Failed to get next debug event. (Error %d.)", GetLastError());
            exit(1);
        }

        // This function will analyze the event type and call an appropriate
        // handler.
        dispatch_event_handler(&event);

        // Return control to the game.
        ContinueDebugEvent(event.dwProcessId, event.dwThreadId, DBG_CONTINUE);
    }
}
```

Now to write the `dispatch_event_handler` function that's invoked by the above
code. There are some nasty details involved here. It turns out that the first
time you hook into a process on windows, it artificially generates a breakpoint
exception to indicate (approximately) where the program entry point is. We
don't care about the program entry point though, so we need some logic to skip
over this event to avoid handling it.

Up until now, we've been ignoring threads, but that won't do anymore. Our
hooker needs to read the processor state right at the moment that the
breakpoint is hit. Processor state is thread-local, so we need to get a handle
on the thread that hit the breakpoint. To do that, we use the `OpenThread`
function passing in the thread ID. Thankfully, the debug event structure
contraints the thread ID, so this is easy. However, rather than call
`OpenThread` every time we handle the breakpoint exception, we'll only do it
the first time for efficiency, and store the thread handle in a global
variable.

```c++
void dispatch_event_handler(LPDEBUG_EVENT event)
{
    // We need to skip the first breakpoint event, since it's artificially
    // generated.
    static char first_try = 1;

    switch(event->dwDebugEventCode)
    {
    case EXCEPTION_DEBUG_EVENT:
        // We only bother with the exception events
        switch(event->u.Exception.ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode)
        {
        case EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT:
            if(first_try)
            {
                first_try = 0;
                break;
            }

            // Open the game thread the second time a breakpoint gets hit.
            if(game_thread == NULL)
            {
                if(NULL ==
                    (game_thread =
                    OpenThread(THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, event->dwThreadId)))
                {
                    printf("Failed to open game thread.\n");
                    exit(1);
                }
            }

            // invoke the breakpoint handling routine.
            on_breakpoint(game_process, game_thread);
            break;

            default:
                printf("Unhandled exception occurred.\n");
                break;
        }
        break;

    default:
        //printf("Unhandled debug event occurred.\n");
        break;
    }
}
```

Finally, we can write the `on_breakpoint` function that will inspect the
processor state in the game thread to read the value in `eax`, and read the
game's memory at that address in order to extract text or metadata. By analogy
with `WriteProcessMemory`, there's `ReadProcessMemory` which does exactly what
we would expect. Thanks to all that debug privilege stuff we did earlier, we
have no special setup needed to use this function now.

There's one more detail that we need to worry about though: the breakpoint that
we set in the game code is overwriting an instruction that used to be doing
something useful! There are at least two options available to us.

* We can remove the breakpoint, restoring the original instruction, before
  returning control to the game. We put the breakpoint back right after
  returning control to the game however.
* We simulate the instruction in the debugger.

I feel like real debuggers use a different strategy than either one of these,
but I found it pretty hard to do research on this short of reading the source
code of existing debuggers, which I wasn't prepared to do for what's supposed
to be just a quick hack.

The former option seems like it introduces race conditions; we might miss a
character or two before the breakpoint is restored. That leaves us only with
the second option of simulating the instruction.

Thankfully, that's not so hard. The instruction that we overwrote, `movzx ecx,
byte ptr [eax]`, copies one byte from the address pointed to by `eax` into
the lowest byte of `ecx`, filling the higher bytes with zero. Our text hooking
logic is going to need to read the value pointed to by `eax` anyway in order to
extract the text, so all we really need to do is do a little write to `ecx`,
and the game won't be able to tell the difference.

There's one more detail that we need to watch out for. The instruction that we
overwrote and that we're now going to be emulating is coded on three bytes,
whereas the breakpoint that we inserted is coded on one byte. Consequently,
there are now two bytes of garbage in the program text that we need to jump
over in order to properly resume execution. To do this jump, it suffices to
increase the value of `eip` by two, which we can do at the same time as we
perform the write to `ecx`.

We can read and write the processor state of a thread with the
`GetThreadContext` and `SetThreadContext` functions, which deal in `CONTEXT`
structs. The contents of this struct varies from architecture to achitecture,
but on x86 it has the fields `Eax`, `Ebx`, `Ecx`, etc. corresponding to the
registers with the same names. The tricky thing is that the registers are
organized into *groups*, and when we use `GetThreadContext` or
`SetThreadContext`, we need to specify which register groups we're reading or
writing by using the `ContextFlags` field of the `CONTEXT` struct. Since we'll
be reading `eax` and writing to `ecx`, which are in the integer register group,
we need to use the `CONTEXT_INTEGER` flag. Since we also want to read and write
to `eip`, which is in the control register group, we'll have to use the
`CONTEXT_CONTROL` flag.

Talk is cheap. Let's see the code.


```c++
void on_breakpoint(HANDLE game_process, HANDLE game_thread)
{
    char sjis[RPM_BUF_SIZE];
    // ^ a buffer to hold the memory that we read from the game memory at
    // the address given in eax.

    SIZE_T b;
    // ^ to be used as an out parameter for reading and writing memory.

    CONTEXT context;
    // ^ the structure holding the processor state.

    LPVOID sjis_addr;
    // ^ we'll store the contents of eax in here

    LPVOID bp_addr;
    // ^ we'll hold the current value of eip in here

    // First, we read the processor state in the game thread.

    // We want to read the integer registers (esp. EAX) and the control
    // registers (esp. EIP)
    context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_INTEGER | CONTEXT_CONTROL;

    if(!GetThreadContext(game_thread, &context))
    {
        printf("Failed to get thread context.\n");
        return;
    }

    // Pull out the breakpoint address from eip and the value of eax, which
    // is a pointer of the next chunk of data to be parsed.
    bp_addr = (LPVOID)context.Eip;
    sjis_addr = (LPVOID)context.Eax;

    // As a sanity check, we'll verify that eip is right after our
    // breakpoint. If it's not, then we'll bail out because it means that
    // some other breakpoint that we didn't put there was hit.
    // Please forgive the nasty casts.
    if(bp_addr != (LPVOID)((DWORD)instruction_address + 1))
    {
        printf("Breakpoint hit at another address, namely 0x%08x.\n", bp_addr);
        return;
    }

    // Now we read the memory of the game at the address that we found in
    // eax in order to get the next character to be read.
    if(!ReadProcessMemory(game_process, sjis_addr, sjis, RPM_BUF_SIZE, &b))
    {
        printf("Failed to read SJIS character from game memory @ 0x%08x. "
                "Read %d bytes. (Error %d.)\n",
                sjis_addr,
                b,
                GetLastError());
    }

    // The instruction that we overwrote was `movzx ecx, byte ptr [eax]`,
    // which is coded on 3 bytes, so we need to jump over the next two
    // bytes which are garbage.
    context.Eip += 2;

    // Reset the context flags to write out in case the call to
    // GetThreadContext changed the flags on us for some reason.
    context.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_CONTROL | CONTEXT_INTEGER;

    // Simulate the overwritten instruction by moving the lowest read byte
    // into ECX. We have to take care to cast it to an unsigned char to
    // ensure that the value is positive, so that when the unsigned char
    // gets implicitly widened to a DWORD (the type of the Ecx field), we
    // actually get zeroes in the high bits instead of ones. (Tracking down
    // that bug was in fact a nightmare.)
    context.Ecx = (unsigned char)sjis[0];

    // Flush the context out to the processor registers.
    if(!SetThreadContext(game_thread, &context))
    {
        printf("Failed to write processor state.");
        return;
    }

    // parse the buffer of data that we read.
    parse_buf(sjis);
}
```

The `parse_buf` function is pretty uninteresting, so I won't include it here.
In a nutshell, it appends text data to a large internal buffer and skips over
metadata. It can decide whether the buffer contains metadata or text by looking
at the first byte. (Recall that the metadata always started with `#`.) If the
buffer starts with a null byte, then we've reached the end of text, and we need
to flush the large internal buffer.

But where do we flush it to?

### The Windows clipboard

My friend is using a nice piece of software called Translation Aggregator, that
monitors the clipboard for changes: when the contents of the clipboard changes,
it updates the contents of a textbox in a window to contain whatever is in the
clipboard. This textbox has some cool features, the most important of which
being that hovering on a kanji will give its reading and hovering on a word
will give its definition. Other text hooking software also writes to the
clipboard, so this is how the usual tools all fit together.

In order to write to the clipboard, we first have to own it. To get ownership
of the clipboard, we use the `OpenClipboard` function. Normally, it's not a
process but a *window* that owns the clipboard; that's why `OpenClipboard`
takes as a parameter a handle to a window. Since our program is a simple
console application, we'll just use `NULL`. (One thing I love/hate about the
Windows API is how frequently you can just use NULL for things. I think
`CreateProcess` takes something like 11 parameters, more than half of which can
just be NULL.)

Then, we can clear the clipboard with `EmptyClipboard` and finally write data
to it with `SetClipboardData`. The catch with `SetClipboardData` is that you
can't just give it a pointer to some data in our program such as our message
buffer, because that pointer wouldn't make sense outside our program's address
space. The solution is to allocate globally shared memory with `GlobalAlloc`.
Once we pass the pointer to `SetClipboardData`, the Windows clipboard wants to
become the owner of the data, so when we allocate the memory with
`GlobalAlloc`, we need to use the `GMEM_MOVABLE` flag to indicate that another
process can assume ownership of the memory. Also, the fact that the clipboard
takes over ownership of the memory means that we don't need to free it in our
code.

The Windows clipboard is a modern, sophisticated thing. It can hold all sorts
of different data. To specify what type of data we're writing to the clipboard
we need to pass a flag to `SetClipboardData`. Well, we're writing text, so we
use the `CF_TEXT` flag.

Alright, program finished. We fire up the game, hook our program in, and launch
Translation Aggregator. But the text comes out all garbled. Well, that's
because the clipboard doesn't know the locale/charset that the text is in!

It just so happens that there's a field in the modern, sophisticated thing that
is the Windows clipboard that serves as a specifier for the locale. Just
passing in `DWORD` to specify the locale would make too much sense; you have to
pass in a pointer to the locale. Of course, just as with the text, we can't
just use any old pointer; we have to use global memory pointers. So we
call `SetClipboardData` again, this time with the `CF_LOCALE` flag and a
global pointer to a `DWORD` holding the locale identifier for Japanese. Phew !

Finally we're done with the clipboard and we can close it with
`CloseClipboard`.

Here's the code.

```c++
void flush_message_buffer()
{
    // msg_offset specifies how much of the internal buffer we've written
    // to so far.
    if(msg_offset == 0)
        return; // nothing to do !

    // null-terminate the buffer
    msg_buf[msg_offset] = '\0';

    // allocate a global buffer to give to the system with the clipboard
    // data.
    HGLOBAL clip_buf = GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE, msg_offset + 1);

    // copy the message buffer into the global buffer
    memcpy(GlobalLock(clip_buf), msg_buf, msg_offset + 1);
    GlobalUnlock(clip_buf);

    // allocate global memory to hold the locale identifier.
    HGLOBAL locale_ptr = GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE, sizeof(DWORD));
    DWORD japanese = 1041;
    memcpy(GlobalLock(locale_ptr), &japanese, sizeof(japanese));
    GlobalUnlock(locale_ptr);

    // Open the clipboard so we can write to it.
    if(!OpenClipboard(NULL))
    {
        printf("Failed to open clipboard. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
        goto cleanup;
    }

    // Remove any data that might already be in the clipboard.
    if(!EmptyClipboard())
    {
        printf("Failed to empty clipboard. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
        goto cleanup;
    }

    // Write the text data to the clipboard.
    if(!SetClipboardData(CF_TEXT, clip_buf))
    {
        printf("Failed to set clipboard data. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
        goto cleanup;
    }

    // Write the locale information to the clipboard.
    if(!SetClipboardData(CF_LOCALE, locale_ptr))
    {
        printf("Failed to set clipboard locale. (Error %d.)\n", GetLastError());
        goto cleanup;
    }

cleanup:

    // Clear the message buffer
    ZeroMemory(msg_buf, msg_offset);
    // Close the clipboard
    CloseClipboard();
    // Reset the offset within the internal buffer to the beginning.
    msg_offset = 0;
}
```

Conclusion
----------

All in all, I wound up using the Windows API a lot more than I ever would have
liked. It's messy. It has a *lot* of typedefs in uppercase. It uses TitleCase
for everything. I had to code in Visual Studio. Ew.

But the text hooker works! And here's where the "and profit" part of the title
is relevant: my friend was so pleased that it worked (he had searched for hours
online for H-codes and guides) that he gave me 50$.

Now let's hope I don't have to use my Windows XP virtual machine again for a
long, long time.
