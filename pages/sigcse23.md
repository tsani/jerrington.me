## Notes

* Evaluating Group Work in (too) Large CS Classes with (too) Few Resources:
    - students work in pairs on three projects
    - assessed based on code, functional tests, but also teamwork:
        - self and peer eval of soft skills via likert scale
        - individual 10 min oral exam once at the end of term conducted by TAs:
              - ask about 2 of the three projects: one the students pick, one the TA picks.
              - ask the same three general questions for each, plus follow up questions
* [Visualized scope tracing](https://blue.butler.edu/~agupta/VST/) (Ankur Gupta)
    - want to share the technique especially with Faten, Giulia who teach intro courses
* Slip day tokens (part of 'it seemed like a good idea at the time')
    - towards a general policy for late-days?
* Executable exams
    - Delivering _exams_ via LearnOCaml?
    - Delivering fully async exams:
        - Academic integrity best practices
* [Programming exercise markup language](https://cssplice.github.io/peml/)
    - towards a common format for describing exercises; applications for LearnOCaml?
* [Spiffy PI questions](https://peerinstruction4cs.com/)
    - have an IDK answer: better to know they're lost than to not know whether they're just
      guessing
    - two-phase PI vs single-vote think-pair-share format
    - colored index-cards with a white back: non-technological and mitigates embarrassment
    - techno approach does mean we can collect data on answers
    - participation points based on answering PI questions
