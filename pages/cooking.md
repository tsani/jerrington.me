Inspired by the [breadmaking journal][/pages/bread.html], this is a journal of other recipes that I
want to gradually improve on. Instead of just folowing random recipes from the internet, eah time I
want to do something like make pancakes or waffles or a cake or whatever, I'll take notes here and
incrementally improve them. That approach worked so well for the bread!

## 15 April 2023: Pancakes

Using more baking powder vs last time

- 1.5 cups flour
- 1.5 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1.5 cups milk
- 3 tbsp melted butter
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

## 18 February 2023: pancakes

- 1.5 cups flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tbsp sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1.5 cups milk
- 3 tbsp melted butter

### How it turned out

These were nice, although they could have stood to be a bit fluffier.
To try next time: 1.5 tbsp baking powder.
