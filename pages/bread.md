I make bread.

Dates for the bread are the day the preparation started, not the day of the bake.

## 7 February 2023

Used the same recipe as 5 February except I poured a bit too much out and getting it back into the
bag is not really possible. I got 145 g milk, so I reduced the amount of water to 90 g. This leads
to a **hydration of 73%**.

The dough was sensibly the same to handle last night. The morning of 8 February I turned it.

I don't have time to bake it this morning, so I'm leaving it to rise for closer to 24h. To make up
for the longer bulk fermentation, I'm using the kitchen table at 18°C rather than the bathroom at a
balmy 22°C if not higher -- I ought to measure some day.

## 5 February 2023

It expanded I would say too much last time. We could go for a touch less.

Going to try to use more milk this time too.

Target hydration: 77%

- 450 g flour
- required water weight `346.5 g` from:
  * **3 whole eggs**:
    - weights `150 g`
    - whole egg hydration is 75%
    - contributes `113 g` of water weight.
  * `125 g` water from milk:
    - milk hydration is 87%
    - so we need **144 g of milk**
  * `108.5 g` water
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 ADY

Another small change I'm making to the preparation is that I'm turning the bread before bed in
addition to when I get up.

It rose a lot overnight.

I'm going to try a slightly gentler bake: 370°F 25 mins lid on, 35 mins lid off.

### How it turned out

Came out much like yesterday's! Lovely blistered crust. Crumb appears to be more airy, which
is a little surprising given that the dough is a touch less hydrated. It may have to do with
slight inconsistency in the folding / kneading. I believe I kneaded the 4 February dough ever so
slightly, whereas today's was only folded

I think the gentler bake was a good idea as well.

Scoring was a failure again. Eric tried to help too, but there is no apparent cut in the baked
loaf, just some markings on the top of the loaf. I really need a sharp instrument.

Also, Eric bought a really nice bread knife and we tossed the old one. The old one's paint was
literally chipping off into the bread leaving small blue flecks that doubtless contain forever
chemicals poisoning us.

## 4 February 2023

I think 68% hydration was too low for good distribution and overnight rise. But clearly, 93% was
perhaps a bit too much as it made the handling too difficult. Let's perform something like
binary search until I find a hydration level & ingredient combo that I like.

Target hydration 80%

- 450 g flour
- required water weight `360 g` from:
    * **3 whole eggs**:
        - weighs `150 g`
        - whole egg hydration is 75%
        - contributes `113 g` of water weight.
    * 100 g water from milk:
        - milk hydration is 88%
        - so need **115 g milk**
    * **150 g water**
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp ADY

I expect this will come out really nice, since the first two loaves I made had 75% hydration.

The 3 February loaf came out _excellent_ so I'm deciding to use milk again and I'll use an extra
egg.

Something I'm questioning is my overnight bulk ferment. I've been doing it with a heated room,
but doing it cold might be better. On the other hand, I've so far enjoyed the yeasty flavour.
Another consideration is the yeast ratio. I've just been using 1/4 tsp and not knowing how much
that weighs. Well it weighs about `1.3 g` according to my fine scale. That's just 0.3%!
For a _cold_ overnight bulk ferment (in the fridge, 6°C) the recommendation is 1%. Makes sense
because a cold ferment happens more slowly, so we need more yeast. In contrast, I can get away with
using much less for a hot bulk ferment. I might consider bulk fermenting simply on the kitchen
counter with something in the middle like 0.7% yeast.

I'll go with the same fermentation properties finally.

The dough absolutely blew up over night. Really big rise. And surprisingly easy to handle! I did
use the bread scraper a bunch since it was sticking here and here, but never too much to my hands.
I turned the bread _in_ the container before folding it out onto the counter. Then turned it again
in the flour on the counter.

### How it turned out

I'm blown away. It's the best loaf yet. Maybe I would lower the hydration by 2% or something, but
otherwise this is it.

It gets _very_ crispy in the toaster, but given how dense it is (despite how airy the crumb is,
there are _three eggs_), even somewhat thin slices remain deliciously chewy in the middle.

I think I could have cooked it a little longer.

## 3 February 2023

- 450 g flour
- 68 % hydration -> 306 g water needed, split among:
    * **100g water**
    * 100g water from milk:
        - milk hydration is 88%
        - 0.88 * x = 100 => x = **115 g milk**
        - (milk was scalded)
    * 75g water from **2 whole eggs**:
        - weighs 100 g
        - egg hydration is 75%
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp yeast

Dough does appear to have doubled in size overnight, but rose WAY less than the previous batch.
Super easy to handle in the morning. Gave it a quick turn and it was pretty much already shaped.
The boule was significantly smaller, so I'm very concerned that the bread will come out _much_
denser than the last batch, but we'll see how the second rise and oven spring go.

I will also make one small adjustment beyond playing with the hydration and fat content and _score_
the boule this time.

I ended up scoring a cross-shape. My paring knife is utter garbage though so the score didn't come
out nearly like the ones one sees online. I'll need a sharper knife, or if I really want to take
this more seriously, get one of those little scoring tools that I'll use only for this so it stays
razor sharp.

I'm expecting the crumb to be muuuuch less airy, due to all the extra fat in the dough from the
eggs and the milk. Given the ingredients, I'm moving along the bread - cake spectrum in the
direction of a cake.

About the bake, following my reading, I decided to bake at a lower temperature for longer. The
presence of all those fats mean that the crust could possibly burn if I bake at 450° as usual.

**Bake:** 415°, 20 min lid on, 30 min lid off.

In fact, I remember smelling something almost like a burn when I baked the previous loaf with
2 whole eggs in it at 450. Fortunately there was no burn at all. The crust was a touch darker for
sure, but nothing too crazy.

### How it turned out

The scoring was a complete failure. The loaf didn't open up at all from it. All we got from scoring
was a cute lighter-colored cross shape on the top of the loaf. I'll need to use a better tool.

The crumb is awesome, the crust is awesome, and the flavour is awesome. Wow. I'm overall really
impressed with how it came out.

It is however juuuuust a _touch_ gummy in the center. On the other hand, the crust is quite dark,
so I don't think I could have baked it for much longer really. I need a slower, gentler bake for
this approach with so many added fats. Perhaps 375°F for 25 mins lid on, 40 mins lid off.

## 1 February 2023

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 2 whole eggs
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Dough was WAY too sticky.
Had to add a ton of flour as I went.
Rose A LOT overnight in the hot bathroom.
Very sticky and tough to handle in the morning.
Added a bunch more flour.
1.5h rise in the morning after shaping.
Same bake; 30min lid off though.

Crumb low key worse. Adding flour before the second rise was a mistake.
Flavour about as good if not better.

I really think ultimately the issue was the water/flour ratio being thrown off in the presence of
the eggs, which are mostly water.

In hindsight, the water content for this dough was
300 g (from water) + 75 g (from 2 whole eggs) = 375 g total.
Therefore the hydration is 375 g / 400 g = 93% !

That explains why the dough was soooo sticky and perhaps also why it rose so much, since hydration
greatly affects resource distribution within the dough.


## Second loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the bathroom with heat on. Rose way more overnight.
Second rise in the morning 2h.
Brushed melted butter on the top of the loaf.
Same bake.

Crumb okay and bottom crust less tough.

## First loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp dry active yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the kitchen. (Not hot.)
Second rise after shaping in the morning 2h.
Bake 15 min dutch oven lid on. 450F. Bake 25 min lid off.

Crumb okay but bottom crust too tough, so shaping could have been better.
