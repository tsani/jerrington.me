I make bread.

Dates for the bread are the day the preparation started, not the day of the bake.

## 11 March 2023

Over the past week I've made a couple of loaves following the usually 'cake bread' recipe involving
eggs and milk. One had decent oven spring, another didn't. I've tried the overnight rise in the
oven with the light on, on the counter, etc. to varying results. I think it's a question of how
much mixing I'm doing and what temperature I let the bread rise at overnight. The kitchen's
temperature varies!

Today I'm going to try to make a simple loaf over the next four ~ five hours and pay extra
attention to kneading technique.

* 500 g flour
* 350 g water (70% hydration)
* 10 g yeast
* two pinches salt

## 3 March 2023

So yesterday I prepared a classic loaf again and let it rise overnight on the counter. It about
doubled in size. I don't know what on earth I was thinking at that point, because then I decided to
use the sous vide to heat it up some more to make it rise more. I did that, but then when I was
shaping the dough it simply wouldn't hold together. It would tear open in the middle and
essentially cave in.

In hindsight, I don't think that had much to do with letting rise too much, but actually more to do
with my shaping technique.
I was really disappointed with the dough since it wasn't holding up and just tossed it ;(

In the evening, I prepared another another dough and let it rise overnight on the counter.
I kneaded it this morning following the Bertinet method and then shaped it. This time I used a
slightly different shaping technique.

It's kind of hard to describe shaping technique in words, but I think I understand why my old
technique was causing the dough to collapse in the middle. I was basically being 'too square'. I
would push the dough from the bottom with the scraper, then the right, then the top, etc.
Ultimately I think this creates little 'rolls' inside the dough but deprives the center of the
dough of any substance.

For the new technique I made a few changes:

* I only _slightly_ move the scraper between pushes, rather than a full 90°.
* I don't remove the scraper entirely from the dough between pushes.
* I always shape in the same direction.

This second point was something of a discovery for me. I was really frustrated by the dough
sticking to my scraper as I pulled it out of the dough, so I thought, "what if I don't pull the
scraper all the way out?" Essentially, the 'stuck' dough gets pushed _back_ into the dough and
eventually becomes tight enough to not stick.

The third point really just means I follow Bertinet's advice: he says to always rotate the dough in
the same way (clockwise if you're right-handed).

Picking up the dough and putting into the container to let it rise again before baking was a bit of
a challenge since it was quite sticky, so it kind of flopped out sideways.

## 1 March 2023

Let's go totally classic recipe here: just flour, water, salt, and yeast.

Let's go with 78% hydration.

- 500 g flour
- 390 g water
- two pinches salt
- 1 tsp ADY

I'm going with a whole tsp ADY since I'm just going to let the bread rise for three hours instead
of my usual overnight schenanigans.

Speaking of overnight, in future overnight bulk ferments, I'm not going to use the bathroom
anymore. I think another reason why the gluten formation is insufficient to hold the bread together
(besides possibly the inclusion of eggs) is that it's fermenting _too much._ Heat plays a big role
in that. Instead I'll let it gently rise overnight on the counter.


## 28 February 2023

Usual recipe.

I paid more attention to the dough as I was shaping it up after the bulk ferment and noticed it was
tearing! Could this be the fault of the eggs? I want to try a loaf without eggs to see.

## 26 February 2023

I prepared two batches of the usual recipe, but this time I have bread flour.

- 1/4 tsp ADY
- 450 g **bread flour**
- 108 g water
- 145 g scalded milk
- 3 whole eggs
- 2 pinches salt

I put both doughs into the bathroom with the heat on around 10 pm and took them out at 8:30 am.
Since it's cold out, I decided that rather than leave the doughs on the vanity as usual that I
would put them _on the floor near the heater,_ one of them more or less directly under it -- dough
A -- and the other a little off to the side -- dough B.

When I took out the doughs, I noticed that dough A had risen less than B. Dough B looked as my
doughs usually do after bulk fermentation. Moreover, the edges of dough A were kind of dry!

So here's what I think happened: dough A was too hot, the fermentation went too fast, and the
gluten _broke down_. In other words, it rose quickly and then deflated as the gluten fell apart and
couldn't support the weight of the dough anymore.

That hypothesis is further corroborated by this: as I began to work the dough this morning, and I
used the scraper to tidy it up, I noticed that rather than stretch on the surface and tighten up,
the dough was _tearing!_ Perhaps this batch is fucked...

## 25 February 2023

Using a preferment:

- 1/4 tsp ADY
- 250 g flour
- 100 g water
- 145 g milk

So almost _all_ of the water content is already in the preferment. What will remain to be added
after is:

- 200 g flour
- 3 whole eggs
- 2 pinches salt

I started the preferment at 13:00. At 16:00 I'll combine with the remaining ingredients and let it
rest 30 minutes. Then I'll shape it and let it rest 1.5h. Then I'll bake it.

Essentially the only things added at the end were the eggs and some flour.  Doing this is more
delicate than I at first thought. I beat the eggs in a separate container and just dumped them on
the preferment, then dumped in the flour and mixed the whole thing. Mixing it properly in a state
like that is VERY challenging, and I just didn't mix it enough.

### How it turned out

I didn't take any pictures, but looking at the crumb, one can see some yellow spots. I think this
is a consequence of the insufficient mixing. The dough texture wasn't uniform, with some spots
having more egg than others, to the point that this is reflected in the appearance of the dough.
The crumb was also substantially denser.

### Ideas for next time

When working with a preferment and wanting to add eggs, I could consider:

1. Putting the eggs directly into the preferment. This avoids entirely the problem of combining the
   eggs later with the preferment.
   I'm already letting my eggs participate in the bulk fermentation when that's how I prepare my
   dough, so what's the problem with having them in the preferment?
2. Fully combining the eggs with the remaining flour before combining with the preferment.
   Consider this: three whole eggs contribute 113 g of water. Therefore with 200 g flour, this
   dough would be quite dry at 56.5% hydration. It's hard to estimate how easy the two doughs will
   be to combine, but it could be worth a try.

## 21 February 2023

We ran out of milk, so I substituted the milk for flour at the appropriate ratio in the usual
recipe.

This morning I noticed that the dough rose _substantially_ less! I'm not exactly sure why, but I
have a few ideas:

- colder dough: the milk is scalded, and then combined with the water (cold) making a ~120°F liquid
  that gets combined with the dough. Since the dough is warmer, the yeast acts faster and produces
  more rise.
- sugar: milk contains sugars, so the yeast eats these up and produces more rise.

It's actually probably a combination of these two. It would probably be fine to go with a colder
dough that has less sugar _if I bulk ferment the dough longer._ I did a ~14 hour bulk ferment as
usual, but it ought to be maybe 24 hours instead.

## 19 February 2023

This time I'm going to try a preferment.

Preferment:

- 110 g water
- 90 g flour
- 0.7 g ADY

Using the immersion circulator to keep the temperature at a perfect 85°F.
Started at 12:30 PM and aiming to assemble the full dough at 8:30 PM.
I'll proceed with a bulk ferment overnight.

This means that the main dough will need:

- 360 g flour (450 g - 90 g)
- NO actual water (it all went in the preferment)
- 145 g milk as before
- 3 whole eggs
- NO extra ADY

After letting it rise overnight, it appears to be MUCH more bubbly than without a preferment.
Also the _smell!_ It smell much more sour, almost vinegary. I'm concerned that it's overripe and
that it won't turn out well in the oven.

### How it turned out

I think it did overproof. The crumb is a little too chewy for my taste. The flavour is okay but not
as good as the previous loaves. Also the crumb came out extremely airy. It could have used for more
kneading. It's also not clear that on the second rise it actually doubled in size. Maybe it was
more like 1.5x.

The scoring worked out a lot better. There's actually a small ear on the bread!
I need to cut much closer to horizontal next time, and I should probably score it _before_
transferring it into the dutch oven, since it's challenging to get the right angle with the dutch
oven being so hot and in the way.

#### Nutrition facts

The total weight of the bread after baking is 700 g, so using the values from last time (since all
the ingredients are the same) I can calculate the nutrition facts. According to the calculations,
45 g of water evaporated during baking.

For a 700 g loaf:

- 1951 kcal
- 353 g carbs
- 70.5 g protein
- 24.5 g fat

For a 30 g slice:

- 83 kcal
- 15 g carbs
- 3 g protein
- 1 g fat

For a 50 g slice:

- 140 kcal
- 25 g carbs
- 5 g protein
- 1.75 g fat

For a 70 g slice (middle of the loaf):

- 196 kcal
- 35 g carbs
- 7 g protein
- 2.45 g fat

#### Cost

While we're doing some math here, it might be nice to calculate how much one of these loaves costs
compared.

- 450 g of flour costs 0.68 $
- 145 g of 3.5% milk costs 0.30 $
- 3 whole eggs cost 0.85 $
- water is free :)
- total: 1.85 $

Much cheaper than the 4.99 $ you normally pay for an "artisan country loaf" isn't it!

## 15 February 2023

Been continuing with the same recipe so far. I'm excited to experiment some more, but simply don't
have the time.

Today, I'm going to calculate the nutrition facts for my bread recipe.

- 125 g all-purpose flour:
  - 455 kcal
  - 95.4 g carbs
  - 12.9 g protein
  - 1.2 g fat
- so in 450 g flour:
  - 1638 kcal
  - 343.5 g carbs
  - 46.5 g protein
  - 4.5 g fat

- 1 large egg:
  - 72 kcal
  - 0.4 g carbs
  - 6.3 g protein
  - 5 g fat
- so in 3 large eggs (150 g):
  - 216 kcal
  - 1.2 g carbs
  - 18.9 g protein
  - 15 g fat

- 145 g milk:
  - 97 kcal
  - 8 g carbs
  - 5 g protein
  - 5 g fat

- in total:
  - 1638 + 216 + 97 = 1951 kcal
  - 343.5 + 1.2 + 8 = 353 g carbs
  - 46.5 + 18.9 + 5 = 70.5 g protein
  - 4.5 + 15 + 5 = 24.5 g fat

- total ingredient weight: 450 + 150 + 145 = 745 g

Now there's one catch. I want to calculate the nutrition for one slice. But it's not enough to just
weigh the slice and prorate the facts based on the total ingredient weight. Why? Because of the
water! There's water content in the eggs, the milk, and in the literal water that's added to the
recipe. During baking, this water is (partially) going to evaporate. It'll furthermore evaporate as
the bread cools. To actually calculate the total facts per 100 g in the final loaf, I'll need to
weight the loaf after it cools, and see how this compares to the total ingredient weight. I expect
it to be a bit heavier, again due to the added ~100 g of water, but it shouldn't be heavier by a
full 100 g because of evaporation.


## 13 February 2023

Same recipe. I noticed it rose a bit less overnight than previously and that the dough was a bit
sturdier. I wonder if my impatience in mixing in the scalded milk + water caused any of the yeast
to die. That might explain why the bread rose less. On the other hand, I pour that mixture into
(cold) beaten eggs while mixing, so it must cool down very fast. Yeast dies around 150°F, and I
think it's unlikely that the mix is that hot. Anyway we'll see how it turns out when it bakes.

## 12 February 2023

Same recipe and again didn't manage to score it. The bread has been pretty consistent

## 11 February 2023

Followed sensibly the same recipe as before. Tried scoring it again to no avail.

## 9 February 2023

I followed sensibly the same recipe as usual now. I bold the major differences.

- 450 g flour
- 350 g -- 78% hydration -- water from:
  * 3 whole eggs:
    - weights `150 g`
    - contributes `113 g` of water weight.
  * `126 g` water from milk:
    - milk hydration is 87%
    - so we need 144 g of milk
  * `108.5 g` water
- **two pinches** of salt
- 1/4 ADY

So really the only difference is that I put some more salt this time.

I left it to rise overnight in the bathroom with the heat on and I baked it in the morning.
I was patient this time around for the second rise. After shaping the boule I let it rest for 1.5h
before baking it. I baked it at 375°F for 20 minutes lid on, 30 minutes lid off. I didn't score it.

### How it turned out

It was excellent. Airy crumb. A bit uneven in its airiness though; some quite large bubbles made it
through. I did somewhat knead the dough, but I might want to be a bit rougher with it next time.

The flavour is good. I might even want to try for more salt next time. I might actually want to
start measuring the salt content and tracking it in my baker's formula.

## 7 February 2023

Used the same recipe as 5 February except I poured a bit too much out and getting it back into the
bag is not really possible. I got 145 g milk, so I reduced the amount of water to 90 g. This leads
to a **hydration of 73%**.

The dough was sensibly the same to handle last night. The morning of 8 February I turned it.

I don't have time to bake it this morning, so I'm leaving it to rise for closer to 24h. To make up
for the longer bulk fermentation, I'm using the kitchen table at 18°C rather than the bathroom at a
balmy 22°C if not higher -- I ought to measure some day.

### At night the day after

After about 24h bulk fermentation on the counter, I turned the bread, but I fucked up: I didn't
shape it; I left it in the container. So I let it rest 20 minutes, then turned it again and shaped
it. I was impatient because I wanted to go to sleep as it was late. I took a shower, waited a
little longer for it to proof (maybe 15 min), then baked it.

### How it turned out

The loaf rose _much_ less; hardly any oven spring. Despite that, the crumb is very airy.
I think ultimately it overproofed. The flavour is fine. A little yeasty.

Overall, it's okay but not as wonderful as the previous two loaves.

Conclusion: prefer a 12h bulk fermentation in a hot room and be patient.

## 5 February 2023

It expanded I would say too much last time. We could go for a touch less.

Going to try to use more milk this time too.

Target hydration: 77%

- 450 g flour
- required water weight `346.5 g` from:
  * **3 whole eggs**:
    - weights `150 g`
    - whole egg hydration is 75%
    - contributes `113 g` of water weight.
  * `125 g` water from milk:
    - milk hydration is 87%
    - so we need **144 g of milk**
  * `108.5 g` water
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 ADY

Another small change I'm making to the preparation is that I'm turning the bread before bed in
addition to when I get up.

It rose a lot overnight.

I'm going to try a slightly gentler bake: 370°F 25 mins lid on, 35 mins lid off.

### How it turned out

Came out much like yesterday's! Lovely blistered crust. Crumb appears to be more airy, which
is a little surprising given that the dough is a touch less hydrated. It may have to do with
slight inconsistency in the folding / kneading. I believe I kneaded the 4 February dough ever so
slightly, whereas today's was only folded

I think the gentler bake was a good idea as well.

Scoring was a failure again. Eric tried to help too, but there is no apparent cut in the baked
loaf, just some markings on the top of the loaf. I really need a sharp instrument.

Also, Eric bought a really nice bread knife and we tossed the old one. The old one's paint was
literally chipping off into the bread leaving small blue flecks that doubtless contain forever
chemicals poisoning us.

<div class="col-2-photo"> <img src="/img/bread/knife.jpeg"> </div>

## 4 February 2023

I think 68% hydration was too low for good distribution and overnight rise. But clearly, 93% was
perhaps a bit too much as it made the handling too difficult. Let's perform something like
binary search until I find a hydration level & ingredient combo that I like.

Target hydration 80%

- 450 g flour
- required water weight `360 g` from:
    * **3 whole eggs**:
        - weighs `150 g`
        - whole egg hydration is 75%
        - contributes `113 g` of water weight.
    * 100 g water from milk:
        - milk hydration is 88%
        - so need **115 g milk**
    * **150 g water**
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp ADY

I expect this will come out really nice, since the first two loaves I made had 75% hydration.

The 3 February loaf came out _excellent_ so I'm deciding to use milk again and I'll use an extra
egg.

Something I'm questioning is my overnight bulk ferment. I've been doing it with a heated room,
but doing it cold might be better. On the other hand, I've so far enjoyed the yeasty flavour.
Another consideration is the yeast ratio. I've just been using 1/4 tsp and not knowing how much
that weighs. Well it weighs about `1.3 g` according to my fine scale. That's just 0.3%!
For a _cold_ overnight bulk ferment (in the fridge, 6°C) the recommendation is 1%. Makes sense
because a cold ferment happens more slowly, so we need more yeast. In contrast, I can get away with
using much less for a hot bulk ferment. I might consider bulk fermenting simply on the kitchen
counter with something in the middle like 0.7% yeast.

I'll go with the same fermentation properties finally.

The dough absolutely blew up over night. Really big rise. And surprisingly easy to handle! I did
use the bread scraper a bunch since it was sticking here and here, but never too much to my hands.
I turned the bread _in_ the container before folding it out onto the counter. Then turned it again
in the flour on the counter.

### How it turned out

I'm blown away. It's the best loaf yet. Maybe I would lower the hydration by 2% or something, but
otherwise this is it.

<div class="col-2-photo"> <img src="/img/bread/2023-02-04-loaf.jpeg"> <img src="/img/bread/2023-02-04-crumb.jpeg"> </div>

It gets _very_ crispy in the toaster, but given how dense it is (despite how airy the crumb is,
there are _three eggs_), even somewhat thin slices remain deliciously chewy in the middle.

I think I could have cooked it a little longer.

## 3 February 2023

- 450 g flour
- 68 % hydration -> 306 g water needed, split among:
    * **100g water**
    * 100g water from milk:
        - milk hydration is 88%
        - 0.88 * x = 100 => x = **115 g milk**
        - (milk was scalded)
    * 75g water from **2 whole eggs**:
        - weighs 100 g
        - egg hydration is 75%
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp yeast

Dough does appear to have doubled in size overnight, but rose WAY less than the previous batch.
Super easy to handle in the morning. Gave it a quick turn and it was pretty much already shaped.
The boule was significantly smaller, so I'm very concerned that the bread will come out _much_
denser than the last batch, but we'll see how the second rise and oven spring go.

I will also make one small adjustment beyond playing with the hydration and fat content and _score_
the boule this time.

I ended up scoring a cross-shape. My paring knife is utter garbage though so the score didn't come
out nearly like the ones one sees online. I'll need a sharper knife, or if I really want to take
this more seriously, get one of those little scoring tools that I'll use only for this so it stays
razor sharp.

I'm expecting the crumb to be muuuuch less airy, due to all the extra fat in the dough from the
eggs and the milk. Given the ingredients, I'm moving along the bread - cake spectrum in the
direction of a cake.

About the bake, following my reading, I decided to bake at a lower temperature for longer. The
presence of all those fats mean that the crust could possibly burn if I bake at 450° as usual.

**Bake:** 415°, 20 min lid on, 30 min lid off.

In fact, I remember smelling something almost like a burn when I baked the previous loaf with
2 whole eggs in it at 450. Fortunately there was no burn at all. The crust was a touch darker for
sure, but nothing too crazy.

### How it turned out

The scoring was a complete failure. The loaf didn't open up at all from it. All we got from scoring
was a cute lighter-colored cross shape on the top of the loaf. I'll need to use a better tool.

The crumb is awesome, the crust is awesome, and the flavour is awesome. Wow. I'm overall really
impressed with how it came out.

<div class='col-2-photo'> <img src=/img/bread/2023-02-03-loaf.jpg> <img src=/img/bread/2023-02-03-crumb.jpg> </div>

It is however juuuuust a _touch_ gummy in the center. On the other hand, the crust is quite dark,
so I don't think I could have baked it for much longer really. I need a slower, gentler bake for
this approach with so many added fats. Perhaps 375°F for 25 mins lid on, 40 mins lid off.

## 1 February 2023

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 2 whole eggs
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Dough was WAY too sticky.
Had to add a ton of flour as I went.
Rose A LOT overnight in the hot bathroom.
Very sticky and tough to handle in the morning.
Added a bunch more flour.
1.5h rise in the morning after shaping.
Same bake; 30min lid off though.

Crumb low key worse. Adding flour before the second rise was a mistake.
Flavour about as good if not better.

I really think ultimately the issue was the water/flour ratio being thrown off in the presence of
the eggs, which are mostly water.

In hindsight, the water content for this dough was
300 g (from water) + 75 g (from 2 whole eggs) = 375 g total.
Therefore the hydration is 375 g / 400 g = 93% !

That explains why the dough was soooo sticky and perhaps also why it rose so much, since hydration
greatly affects resource distribution within the dough.


## Second loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the bathroom with heat on. Rose way more overnight.
Second rise in the morning 2h.
Brushed melted butter on the top of the loaf.
Same bake.

Crumb okay and bottom crust less tough.

## First loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp dry active yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the kitchen. (Not hot.)
Second rise after shaping in the morning 2h.
Bake 15 min dutch oven lid on. 450F. Bake 25 min lid off.

Crumb okay but bottom crust too tough, so shaping could have been better.
