I make bread.

## 3 February 2023

- 450 g flour
- 68 % hydration -> 306 g water needed, split among:
    * **100g water**
    * 100g water from milk:
        - milk hydration is 88%
        - 0.88 * x = 100 => x = **115 g milk**
    * 75g water from **2 whole eggs**:
        - weighs 100 g
        - egg hydration is 75%
- pinch of salt
- 1/4 tsp yeast


## 1 February 2023

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 2 whole eggs
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Dough was WAY too sticky.
Had to add a ton of flour as I went.
Rose A LOT overnight in the hot bathroom.
Very sticky and tough to handle in the morning.
Added a bunch more flour.
1.5h rise in the morning after shaping.
Same bake; 30min lid off though.

Crumb low key worse. Adding flour before the second rise was a mistake.
Flavour about as good if not better.

I really think ultimately the issue was the water/flour ratio being thrown off in the presence of
the eggs, which are mostly water.

## Second loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the bathroom with heat on. Rose way more overnight.
Second rise in the morning 2h.
Brushed melted butter on the top of the loaf.
Same bake.

Crumb okay and bottom crust less tough.

## First loaf ever

- 400 g flour
- 300 g water
- 1/4 tsp dry active yeast
- pinch of salt

Left to rise overnight in the kitchen. (Not hot.)
Second rise after shaping in the morning 2h.
Bake 15 min dutch oven lid on. 450F. Bake 25 min lid off.

Crumb okay but bottom crust too tough, so shaping could have been better.
