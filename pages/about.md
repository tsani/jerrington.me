title: Who am I?

I am a well-rounded software developer and computer science educator based in Montreal with both a
broad skillset and deep technical expertise. I hold a master's degree in computer science from
McGill University.

My technical professional experience spans nearly a decade. It includes (full-stack) web
development, systems integration, systems engineering, high-performance computing, programming
languages development, low-latency computing, big data warehousing, and even academic research in
theoretical computer science.

Besides technical know-how, I am a faculty member of McGill's School of Computer Science, where I
teach first- and second-year courses on systems and programming language theory to roughly a
thousand students each year. Recurring highlights from student evaluations of my teaching are the
clarity of my communication and my exceptional organizational ability.

Together with my partner Eric Mayhew, I run a workshop through McGill's
[CDSI](https://mcgill.ca/cdsi) about machine learning fundamentals in Python -- this is the
continuation of our work beginning in 2017 on teaching CS in informal contexts, called
[Computing Workshop](https://computing-workshop.com).

Outside of work, I have a fondness of fitness-related activities. In the warmer months, I spend as
much time as I can outside and on my bike -- in summer 2025, I cycled 1500km. In the colder months,
I prefer to stay inside, at the gym, lifting weights.
