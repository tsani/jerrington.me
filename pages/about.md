I am a well-rounded software developer based in Montreal with both a broad skillset and deep
technical expertise. I hold a master's degree in computer science from McGill University.

My technical professional experience spans nearly a decade. It includes (full-stack) web
development, systems integration, systems engineering, high-performance computing, programming
languages development, low-latency computing, big data warehousing, and even academic research in
theoretical computer science.

Besides technical know-how, I also have experience as a faculty member of McGill's School of
Computer Science, where I taught first- and second-year courses on systems and programming to
thousands of undergraduate students over three years. Recurring highlights from student evaluations
of my teaching are the clarity of my communication, and my exceptional organizational ability.

I'm eager to bring these skills to the table in addressing your business's technology needs.
